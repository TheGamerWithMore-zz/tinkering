<!-- oh yeah, and this website uses a lot of emojis, if your device doesn't support some emojis, they might come up as squares or diamonds with question marks in them. not my fault, not yours, but your device manufacturer's fault.
they're probably still using an out of date OS like MediaTek MAUI or Qualcomm BREW.-->
